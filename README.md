# Crystal Collectors
## Game Objective:
```
A target number is generated randomly between 19-120. 4 crystal with a random number between 1-12 will appear on the page however this value is hidden from the player and will change each game along with the target number. The objective of the game is to reach the target number using only the 4 jewels. Each click will add the jewels number to your number. GL HF!
```
## Hints and Tips
* Jewel numbers do not appear after you click on them. You should write it down do not forget what their values are later.
* Sometimes a single jewel is all you need to reach the target number. See if the target number is divisible by that jewel value!
* Do math!
